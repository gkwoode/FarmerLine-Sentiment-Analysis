1,3,Managing Soil Fertility & Planting Techniques,And planting? Is there a specific time or method?,"Corn loves warmth. Wait until the soil temperature reaches 50°F or higher. Plant seeds about 1.5 to 2 inches deep, spaced 8 to 12 inches apart in rows."
1,4,Managing Soil Fertility & Planting Techniques,Got it. How about irrigation?,"Corn needs consistent moisture, especially during pollination. Aim for 1 to 1.5 inches of water per week."
1,5,Managing Soil Fertility & Planting Techniques,Thanks! Any tips on pest control?,Watch out for corn borers and aphids. Regular scouting and using insecticides when needed will help.
2,6,Orchards and Fruit Trees,My apple trees have yellowing leaves. What’s wrong?,Yellow leaves could indicate nutrient deficiencies. Have you fertilized recently?
2,7,Orchards and Fruit Trees,Not recently. What should I use?,"A balanced fertilizer with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Apply it in early spring."
2,8,Orchards and Fruit Trees,And pruning? When should I do it?,Prune during dormancy (late winter or early spring). Remove dead or crowded branches to improve air circulation.
2,9,Orchards and Fruit Trees,Thanks! What about apple scab disease?,Apple scab thrives in wet conditions. Use fungicides and remove fallen leaves to prevent its spread.
3,10,Tomato Troubles,My tomato plants have yellowing leaves too. Help!,Yellowing leaves might be due to nutrient deficiencies or overwatering. Check the soil moisture and consider adding balanced fertilizer.
3,11,Tomato Troubles,Should I stake my tomato plants?,Yes! Staking prevents fruit rot and improves air circulation. Use sturdy stakes or cages.
3,12,Tomato Troubles,And pests?,Watch for aphids and hornworms. Neem oil or insecticidal soap can help.
4,13,Berry Bushes,My raspberry bushes are wilting. What should I do?,Wilting could be due to root rot. Ensure proper drainage and avoid overwatering.
4,14,Berry Bushes,Pruning?,Prune raspberries after fruiting. Remove old canes to encourage new growth.
4,15,Berry Bushes,Any pests to watch out for?,Keep an eye on spider mites and aphids. Regular spraying can prevent infestations.
5,16,Nut Trees,My pecan tree isn’t producing well. Help!,Pecans need full sun and well-drained soil. Fertilize in spring and prune to improve air circulation.
5,17,Nut Trees,When should I harvest pecans?,"Harvest when the husks split open. Dry them in a warm, dry place."
5,18,Nut Trees,Pests?,Pecan weevils can be a problem. Use traps and insecticides if needed.
6,19,Soybean Planting Preparation,I'm new to planting soybeans. How should I prepare my ﬁeld?,"Hi! Great to hear about your soybean plans. First, test your soil for pH and nutrients. Soybeans prefer well-aerated soil with a neutral pH."
6,20,Soybean Planting Preparation,How do I test my soil?,You can use a home testing kit or send a sample to an agricultural extension service. Testing helps you understand soil needs.
6,21,Soybean Planting Preparation,What about planting time and method?,Wait until after the last frost when soil reaches 60°F. Plant seeds 1.5 inches deep in rows spaced 20 to 30 inches apart.
6,22,Soybean Planting Preparation,How much water do they need?,"Aim for about an inch of water per week, especially during pod formation. Watch for pests and use eco-friendly pesticides if needed."
7,23,Peach Orchard Management,My peach trees are dropping fruit early. Any advice?,Premature fruit drop could be due to pests or disease. Check for insects or spots on the fruit.
7,24,Peach Orchard Management,What should I do if I ﬁnd pests or disease?,Manage fruit ﬂies with clean surroundings and traps. Treat bacterial spot disease early with copper-based sprays.
7,25,Peach Orchard Management,"How about the hot, dry weather?",High temperatures and dryness stress trees. Mulch to retain soil moisture and consider drip irrigation for direct root watering.
8,26,Boosting Wheat Yield,My wheat yield is declining. Any tips?,Crop rotation and soil testing are key. Try legumes before wheat to ﬁx nitrogen and test soil nutrients and pH.
8,27,Boosting Wheat Yield,What else can I do?,"Split nitrogen fertilizer applications for better uptake. Choose resistant seed varieties and provide consistent, adequate water."
8,28,Boosting Wheat Yield,What about irrigation?,"Wheat likes consistent moisture, especially during key growth stages. Use drip or sprinkler irrigation for controlled watering."
9,29,Potato Blight Prevention,My potatoes are affected by blight. How can I stop it?,Choose blight-resistant potato varieties. Ensure good airﬂow and avoid overhead watering.
9,30,Potato Blight Prevention,How do I handle watering?,"Drip irrigation keeps leaves dry, reducing blight risk. Apply fungicides preventively and rotate crops to break disease cycles."
10,31,Fruit Tree Health Improvement,My fruit trees aren't productive. Any advice?,Regular pruning is crucial for fruiting. Fertilize with balanced nutrients in spring and summer.
10,32,Fruit Tree Health Improvement,When should I fertilize?,Apply fertilizer early in spring and mid-summer. Avoid late-season fertilization to prevent winter damage.
11,33,Rice Water Management,How should I manage water for my rice ﬁelds?,Consider alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation. Flood after planting and allow drying before re-ﬂooding.
11,34,Rice Water Management,How do I implement that?,"Flood ﬁelds after planting, then let them dry slightly. Repeat throughout the season. Level ﬁelds for even water distribution."
12,35,Transitioning to Organic Farming,I want to go organic. What should I know?,Start by ceasing synthetic fertilizer and pesticide use. Add compost for soil health.
12,36,Transitioning to Organic Farming,How long does the transition take?,About three years for organic certiﬁcation. Use integrated pest management and focus on soil health.
12,37,Transitioning to Organic Farming,Any tips for pest control?,Use traps and beneﬁcial insects. Rotate crops and maintain soil health for pest resistance.
